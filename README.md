# pi-bci
What is this: Low-Cost Brain Computer Interface designs. BCI hardware is expensive and manufacturing is focused on medical and research applications where $2000 is an accepable price to pay for materials. pi-bci aims to get the component costs at ~$100 and make it relatively easy for students and hobbyists to play with brain computer interfaces using EEGs etc. 

How to build an $X BCI rig:

1. Raspberry Pi (any model is acceptable, but the 'zero w' series is recommended due to form factor and GPIO connectivity. 
All pins that have “GPIO” in the name can be programmed in the os. Use these with the ground and voltage pins to implement the designs.
